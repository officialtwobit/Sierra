# Sierra Loader

Sierra is a versatile and secure remote loader, developed in Delphi, designed for encrypted networking and flexible execution of payloads. It includes essential features like AES encryption, persistence mechanisms, and real-time client monitoring, all crafted in just one day. As an early release, I welcome bug reports and feature suggestions to enhance Sierra further.
## Features

- **TCP Networking**: Reliable communication over the TCP protocol.
- **AES Encrypted Networking**: Secure data transmission with AES encryption, utilizing a custom encryption key.
- **EXE Payload**: Remotely execute EXE payloads on target systems.
- **Remote Execution**: Launch files either from a URL or the local disk on the client machine.
- **Remote Scripting**: Execute custom batch, PowerShell, VBS, or JavaScript scripts remotely.
- **IP Block**: Restrict or block specific IP addresses to enhance security and control access.
- **Registry Persistence**: Maintain persistence on the target machine by adding a registry key for automatic re-execution.
- **Auto Tasks**: Automatically execute files or run CMD commands upon client connection.
- **World Map Monitoring**: View a global map to track and manage all connected clients in real-time.
- **UI Theme Customization**: Personalize the user interface with unique and visually appealing themes.
- **Multithreading Support**: Handle multiple clients simultaneously for efficient management.

Sierra has been developed primarily for educational purposes to demonstrate the concepts of remote administration, secure networking, and client management. It serves as an example of how encryption, remote scripting, and persistence mechanisms can be implemented, providing an opportunity to learn and understand how such systems function.

Important: This tool is not intended for malicious use. Please use it responsibly and only within legal and ethical boundaries, such as on systems you own or have explicit permission to test on.

The project is open-source to encourage learning, collaboration, and improvement within the community. By making it available to the public, I hope to foster discussions around security, networking, and ethical hacking. Contributions, bug reports, and feature suggestions are always welcome as we continue to refine and improve the tool.

If you find Sierra useful, feel free to fork, modify, and adapt it to fit your educational needs. Please remember to use it responsibly!

PS.
I don't believe playit.gg and other port forwarding services work with Sierra, however you can test it and see.
